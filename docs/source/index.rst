Hill Climber Documentation
==========================

A flexible simulated annealing optimizer for generating synthetic datasets with specific statistical properties.

**Hill Climber** is a Python package that uses simulated annealing to optimize datasets according to user-defined objective functions. It's particularly useful for:

- Generating synthetic data with specific statistical properties
- Exploring relationships between different correlation measures
- Creating datasets for testing and benchmarking
- Educational demonstrations of optimization algorithms
